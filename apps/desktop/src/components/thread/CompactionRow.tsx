/**
 * "Context compacted" — the seam in the thread where the runtime summarized the
 * older turns to stay inside the model's context window (#62).
 *
 * This is a real event in the conversation's history: turns the reader can
 * still scroll to are no longer turns the model can see. It used to render as
 * a hairline and muted 11px text, which in a long thread meant the most
 * consequential thing that happened to the context was the least visible thing
 * on screen. So it now carries the warn accent and a filled chip — loud enough
 * to find while scrolling back, still a divider rather than a message from the
 * agent, because the conversation genuinely continues across it.
 *
 * Expanding says when it happened and whether the runtime decided on its own,
 * so context management stays auditable instead of invisible.
